### Learn python while playing

This repository contains the content of the course I taught as a Python instructor. Hopefully will have the time, energy and everything else that may be required to transform this in to a book soon.

At the moment it mostly consists of the examples used in the course. The near-future goal is to include explanations alongside them.
